              I am currently a fifth year PhD student in the <a href = "https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/"> Department of Statistics & Data Science</a> at the <a href = "https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/" target = "_blank">The Wharton School </a>, <a href = "https://www.upenn.edu/" target = "_blank"> University of Pennsyvania </a>, where I am fortunate to have been advised by <a href = "https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/dsmall/" target = "_blank"> Prof. Dylan Small </a>. During my time at Penn, I have also had the opportunity to collaborate closely with <a href="https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/ett/" target="_blank"> Prof. Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen</a>. Before joining Penn, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Statistics from the <a href="https://www.isical.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata</a>.

        My research primarily focuses on causal inference, and asking causal questions is a quick way to grab my attention. Specifically, I am interested in:  
        
        <ul>
          <li><span style="color: var(--olive-color); font-weight:600;">Sensitivity analysis to unmeasured confounding</span></li>
          <li><span style="color: var(--olive-color); font-weight:600;">Double-debiased machine learning (DML)</span></li>
          <li><span style="color: var(--olive-color); font-weight:600;">Causal inference under network interference</span></li>
          <li><span style="color: var(--olive-color); font-weight:600;">Heterogeneity of treatment effects</span></li>
        </ul>
        
        Beyond causal inference, I am also interested in 
        <span style="color: var(--olive-color); font-weight:600;">anytime-valid inference</span>, 
        <span style="color: var(--olive-color); font-weight:600;">differential privacy</span>, 
        <span style="color: var(--olive-color); font-weight:600;">selective inference</span>, 
        and <span style="color: var(--olive-color); font-weight:600;">inference with strategic agents</span>.  
        
        I have spent two summers at Amazon: in 2023, I developed anytime-valid DML for causal inference, and in 2024, I used proximal causal inference to design better loss functions for regional demand forecasting.  
        
        When Iâ€™m not tangled up in causal riddles, you can find me curled up with a good book, experimenting in the kitchen, or hunched over a game of chess.
